<p>
    This implementation of CMD-Auth's specifications is offered under
    the MIT License (MIT) by the creator of CleanDeck / CMD-Auth stack, Iotu Nicolae (nicolae.g.iotu@link133.com).
</p>

<p>
    The application is designed to connect with a live CMD-Auth REST Server (or a load balancing scheme when more
    CMD-Auth Servers are required) and deploy a powerful web application which can be accessed
    in any browser/device.<br>
    The core application includes all the features required in order to enable developers to continue
    the development of complex mega-scale, fully distributed REST applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>call CMD-Auth endpoints and capture response while making sure the session id is updated when required</li>
    <li>perform AJAX calls</li>
    <li>handle MFA</li>
    <li>use administration endpoints exposed by CMD-Auth</li>
    <li>use Google Auth for signup and login</li>
    <li>use specialized cloud tools such as AWS SDK for PHP</li>
    <li>call specialized cloud services such as AWS SES in order to send i.e. sign-up and other important
        notifications
    </li>
    <li>upload, download and delete files from AWS S3 buckets</li>
    <li>respond to errors and success messages</li>
    <li>use cookies in order to save and recover form data, and repopulate forms</li>
    <li>secure forms using captcha and CSRF</li>
    <li>paginate a response</li>
    <li>a.m.o.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Keep your stack RESTful.<br>
    CMD-Auth operates using cookies and databases.
    For the remaining parts of the stack including this application, where a decision must be made,
    if possible, choose cookies in order to keep the stack RESTful and efficient.
</p>

<p>
    The validation is performed at a minimal level. This is intentional and enables developers to adjust CMD-Auth's
    setting 'restrict_characters' in order to match target alphabets such as cyrillic a.o.
</p>

<p>
    Please study CleanDeck libraries if you are planning on implementing other ways of interacting with
    CMD-Auth endpoints.

    Please contact directly using the details posted in <strong>composer.json</strong> instead of posting publicly
    critical errors or bugs you may discover.
</p>

<p>
    WARNING! Never leave ENVIRONMENT variable set to 'development' in production!<br>
    When ENVIRONMENT variable is set to 'development', error messages include restricted information and some
    operations such as signup or MFA login will show confidential information which is useful only during development
    (such as the activation_hash and authentication code).
