# Expansion

## Backend
At the moment CleanDeck uses only CMD-Auth compatible backends, but this is intended to change.<br>
If your proposed system meets high standards of quality, performance, reliance, security and ease of use, then
contact at the address specified in **composer.json**.


## Templates
A templating system is included with the framework. At the moment we will only handle the **core** template which is
based on Bootstrap.<br>
It is a good idea to take charge of other templates using probably different CSS and Javascript libraries.<br>
Custom templates must be mobile friendly.


## Cloud Providers
Looking to expand and improve interactions with other cloud providers.<br>
If you can do it or do it better, then please contribute.<br>
At the moment using AWS for all cloud related stuff except OAuth which is handled using Google Cloud.


## Others
Submit expansion proposals at the address specified in **composer.json**.
